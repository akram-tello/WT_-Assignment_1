            <h2>WHO AM I ?</h2>
            <p>Hello there, my name is Salem Omar, a software engineering student at University Technology of Malaysia. This is my personal page,
                 which I made for my project in the web technology course, so have fun 
            </p>

                <img src="images/FOOTBALL.png" alt="" width="350" height="250px" style="float: left;">
                <h3>Football</h3>
                <p>Football is my favorite sport as I enjoy watching and playing it. I started playing it at the age of six and joined many local clubs. 
                    My favorite team is Real Madrid as they are considered one of the best teams in the world.</p>

            <div class="card" id="card">
                <img src="images/FPS.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="250px" style="float: left;">
                <h3>Video Games</h3>
                <p>I also dread video games especially FPS ones like Valorant and Csgo which depend greatly on the player's skill and ability to work in a team.
                    But you should be aware that it consumes a lot of time, so I prefer playing at the weekend when I am free.</p>

                <img src="images/prog.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="250px" style="float: left;">
                <h3>Programming</h3>
                <p>Of course, I love programming, as it is the reason for my entry into this specialty, as since I was young I wondered about how to make programs 
                    and games, and I was looking for gaps in games so that I could dazzle my friends.  So programming is part of my daily routine as I practice daily.</p>

                  <p>Becoming a software engineer is not easy, as it is a purely competitive field, so you must possess a lot of practical skills and academic qualifications to become a software engineer.</p>

                    <h2>Memorize the Holy Quran</h2>
                    <p>From a young age, I memorized the Qur’an, but unfortunately I had to stop for a while, as I have memorized approximately 13 chapters, but I am thinking of returning soon and preserving
                         it completely as it is considered the greatest pride of a Muslim as it is one of my parents’s wishes.</p>

                    <h2>Learning a new language before graduating </h2>
                    <p>Currently, I only speak Arabic and English, but I am planning to learn Malay as I have a preference at the moment because I study in it, which will make it easier for you to practice the 
                        language.  Also, it is an easy language to learn, as there are many similar words between it and Arabic and English.</p>
